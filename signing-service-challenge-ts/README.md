# Signature Service - Coding Challenge

## Instructions

Welcome challenger!  
When you see this, you have successfully passed the first interview at fiskaly. Now
comes the time to prove yourselves. We have the following challenge prepared for you,
containing elements from frontend development, backend development as well as database
handling. Now let's jump right into it!

### Project Setup

In order for you to not start from scratch with everything we provide you with:

- Set up TS project
- API utilities
- Encoding / Decoding of different key types (ECC, RSA)

You can use these things as a foundation, but you're also open to modify them how you see fit.

### Prerequisites & Tooling

- NodeJs (v16+)

### The Challenge

The aim is to implement an API service that allows customers to create "signature devices" with which they can sign
arbitrary transaction data.

#### Domain Description

Our signature service can manage multiple signature devices. Such a device is identified by a unique identifier
(e.g. UUID). For now, we can pretend there is only one user / organisation using the system (e.g. a dedicated node
for them) and therefore need not think about user management.

When creating the signature device, the client of the API specifies the signature algorithm that the device will be
using to sign transaction data. During the creation process, a new key pair (public key & private key) has to be
generated and assigned to the device.

The signature device should also have a `label` that can be used to display it in a UI and a `signature_counter` that
tracks how many signatures have been performed. While the `label` is provided by the user, the `signature_counter` shall
only be modified internally.

##### Signature Creation

For the signature creation the client will have to provide `data_to_be_signed` through the API. In order to increase
the security of the system, we will extend this raw data with the current `signature_counter` as well as the `last_signature`.

The resulting string should follow this format: `<signature_counter>_<data_to_be_signed>_<last_signature_base64_encoded>`

For the base case that there is no `last_signature` (= `signature_counter == 0`) we will use the `base64` encoded
device ID (`last_signature = base64(device.id)`).

This special string will be signed (`Signer.sign(secured_data_to_be_signed)`) and the resulting signature
(`base64` encoded) will be returned to the client. A signature response could look like this:

```json
{
    "signature": <signature_base64_encoded>,
    "signed_data": "<signature_counter>_<data_to_be_signed>_<last_signature_base64_encoded>"
}
```

After the signature has been created, its value shall be increased by one (`signature_counter += 1`).

#### API

For now, we need to provide two operations to our customers:

- `CreateSignatureDevice(id: string, algorithm: 'ECC' | 'RSA', [optional]: label): CreateSignatureDeviceResponse`
- `SignTransaction(data: string): SignatureResponse`

Think of how to expose these operations through a RESTful HTTP based API.

List / retrieval operations can optionally be implemented but aren't necessary by any means.

#### QA / Testing

As we're in the area of compliance technology we need to make sure that our implementation is verifiable correct.
Think of an automatable way to assure the correctness (in this challenge: adherence to the specifications) of the system.

#### Technical Constraints & Considerations

- The system will be used by many concurrent clients accessing the same resources.
- The `signature counter` shall be strictly monotonically increasing and ideally without any gaps.
- The system currently only supports `RSA` and `ECDSA` as signature algorithms. Try to design the signing mechanism
  in a way that allows easy extension to other algorithms without changing the core domain logic.
- For now it is sufficient to use flat files (e.g. JSON) to persist data. Efficiency is not a priority for this. We
  might want to scale out though, therefore try to think of how to allow easy swapping of your persistence logic to a
  database system such as PostgreSQL.

#### Credits

This challenge is heavily influenced by the KassenSichV (Germany) as well as the RKSV (Austria) and our solutions for them.
